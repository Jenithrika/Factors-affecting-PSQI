 I collected over 250 data points using Simple Random Sampling Without Replacement (SRSWOR) to ensure unbiased representation of the population. The data underwent univariate analysis, where visualizations such as pie charts, bar plots, and histograms were utilized to understand the distribution and central tendencies of individual variables. To explore relationships between variables, I performed bivariate analysis using non-parametric tests like the Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests, which helped identify significant relationships between independent factors and the outcome variable. Building upon these insights, I developed a Multiple Linear Regression model using stepwise regression to pinpoint the most impactful predictors. The model was further validated through secondary research, ensuring that the results aligned with established findings, thereby enhancing the reliability and relevance of the conclusions.
